Throughout my career, I’ve developed skills to support and expand the possibilities of each company I’ve worked for. I’ve produced an emmy-winning TV show from a shoestring budget; promoted and enhanced an ethics institute’s outreach programs; and, I’ve spent the last two and a half years finding and executing solutions for a prominent industrial supply company's website and print catalog. 

I was constantly learning. I filled-in organizational gaps by identifying, proposing, and executing solutions. My results optimized and updated the stale processes, and also developed clear-cut responses to customer pain points. Through all of my work, I have approached each experience with passion and an authentic desire to help. 

Last year, I moved across the country with my partner to live in San Francisco. I was ready to look for a new career. In an odd bit of luck during the pandemic, I was able to continue working remotely at my Chicago position. Today, I'm ready for the next step in my career, and I hope you'll join me.
